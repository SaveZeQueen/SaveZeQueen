- 👋 Hi, I’m @SaveZeQueen
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Game Dev, Pixel Art, and much much more. Friends call me a jack of all trades. 
I learn very quickly and love to pick up new bits of knowledge.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and more Java/JavaScript, I'd love to attempt using them to work on some projects.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, hit me up!
